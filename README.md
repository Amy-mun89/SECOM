## Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Industry


The aim of this case study is to learn how to deal with complex datasets and an overwhelming number of variables
and write professional scripts in R.
Data cleansing and feature selection or reduction methods should be used before applying data mining methods to predict defaults.

The SECOM data set in the Machine Learning Repository (2008) provides information of the manufacturing process in the semiconductor industry. 
In this sector, the production line is being monitored by using many sensors. Thatâ€™s because the production is difficult and defaults in later stages of the production are particularly
expensive. The monitoring of the production lines by using many sensors results in datasets with many variables. In contrast, statistical models to make predictions of the default of certain product
s should be built only based on as less variables as necessary. We call this a parsimonious model with great exploratory power.
